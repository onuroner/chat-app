# Fullstack Chat App

This project was created using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. I used "zustand" library for the state management in React. Socket.io library was used to create the messaging dynamics in the project. MongoDB was used as the database.

You can review the project from this url: https://chat-app-dvgi.onrender.com 

It may take 50-60 seconds to open the link, because I used the free version for deployment :)
